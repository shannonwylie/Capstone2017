=begin
Pirate Tasks contain the Task information related to a specific User. This is done via associations that
link the Pirate Task to similar information as Tasks. Each Pirate Task belongs to a specific User as well as
a Pirate Hunt that should belong to that same User. A Pirate Task also belongs to the Task that it is a 
personalized copy of and the Hunt that that Task belongs to. Pirate Tasks can have file attached to them
for submissions such as Photos, so code related to that is used as well.
