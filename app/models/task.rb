#Task Model allows there to be a field of tasks that are
# associated with hunts because tasks belong to hunts in our model
# architecture. That way we can know which tasks coincide with the 
# proper hunt. Otherwise there would just be tasks running crazy and 
# not allocating their points to the right hunt.
